# The world's people pipeline

`people.mjs` turns character exports into the files `agentdata/fleet/static/world/people/` holds:
`<id>.glb` for the player's character and `<id>_crowd.glb` for the pedestrians. It is how the CC0
stand-in was made, and it is how MetaHuman exports go in.

Needs Node 22 and the pinned tools (`npm ci` in `tools/world`, see `../README.md`). From `tools/world`:

    node people/people.mjs <config.json> [only-this-output-id]

## What it does

For each character, in order:

1. Reads each source (`.glb` or `.gltf`; several files merge, e.g. a MetaHuman's body, face and hair
   cards) and skins every vertex to the rest pose in world space, so exporter conventions (mesh node
   transforms, inverse bind matrices) all come out the same. Meshes without a skin (hair cards, glasses
   exported as static meshes) are bound to `attach` (default `head`).
   With `"pose": "bind"` the rest pose is the one the inverse bind matrices hold rather than the
   nodes' own transforms: an export saved mid-animation (Fab's "Animated" characters are saved
   sitting or walking) otherwise comes out in that pose.
2. Finds the world frame: metres (an export over 20 units tall is taken as centimetres, or set
   `scale`), Y up (`"up": "z"` for a Z-up file; without `up`, a character more than twice as deep in Z
   as it is tall in Y is taken as Z-up), facing -Z (from the feet: `foot_l` to `ball_l`; or
   set `facing`), feet on y = 0, pelvis over the origin.
3. Keeps the Unreal Engine body bones (`pelvis`, `spine_01`..`spine_05`, `neck_01`, `neck_02`, `head`,
   `clavicle/upperarm/lowerarm/hand_l/r`, `thigh/calf/foot/ball_l/r`, and the 30 finger bones for the
   hero) and gives every other bone's weight (MetaHuman's ~800 `FACIAL_*` bones, twist, corrective and
   metacarpal bones) to its nearest kept parent, four influences per vertex. `rename` maps other names.
4. Sorts primitives into roles by material name, then node/mesh name (`ROLE_RULES`; `roles` in the
   config prepends rules): skin, eyes, brows, lashes, hair, beard, glasses, top, bottom, shoes, outfit
   (split into top and bottom by the bones each piece moves with), other, or drop (MetaHuman's eye
   occlusion, tear line, eye shell, cartilage, teeth and tongue are dropped).
5. Adds a morph target per `variants` entry (the same character exported with another body; the vertex
   counts must match) with its joint and head-anchor offsets.
6. Drops glasses' lenses, decimates each role to `tris`, quantises (`KHR_mesh_quantization`), and turns
   every tintable colour map (skin, top, bottom, hair, brows, lashes, beard) into a detail map with its
   mean colour normalised, so the world can dye it; WebP at `texture` sizes (`EXT_texture_webp`).
7. Crowd outputs: every character at each `lods` entry, one primitive each, one atlas texture for all,
   and a `_ROLE` vertex attribute (0 skin, 1 top, 2 bottom, 3 hair, 4 shoes, 5 other) for per-pedestrian
   tints.

Hair, beard and glasses primitives carry a `style` (the node name after its role prefix, e.g.
`hair.afro01` is style `afro01`); `people.json` maps the picker's values to those styles.

## Config

`standin.config.json` here is the stand-in's; a MetaHuman set looks like this:

```json
{
  "out": "out",
  "outputs": [
    { "id": "metahuman_ada", "kind": "hero",
      "sources": ["mh/ada_body_LOD1.glb", "mh/ada_face_LOD2.glb", "mh/ada_hair_cards_LOD2.glb"],
      "tris": {"skin": 14000, "outfit": 9000, "shoes": 2000, "hair": 6000, "beard": 2000, "glasses": 1000},
      "texture": {"skin": 1024, "top": 1024, "bottom": 1024, "hair": 1024, "shoes": 512, "eyes": 256,
                  "brows": 256, "lashes": 256, "beard": 512, "glasses": 256},
      "normals": ["skin", "outfit", "shoes"], "normalSize": 1024 },
    { "id": "metahuman_crowd", "kind": "crowd",
      "characters": [{"name": "ada", "sources": ["mh/ada_body_LOD3.glb", "mh/ada_face_LOD5.glb", "mh/ada_hair_cards_LOD5.glb"]},
                     {"name": "bo",  "sources": ["mh/bo_body_LOD3.glb",  "mh/bo_face_LOD5.glb",  "mh/bo_hair_cards_LOD5.glb"]}],
      "tile": {"skin": 512, "top": 512, "bottom": 512, "hair": 256, "shoes": 256, "eyes": 64},
      "lods": [{"tris": {"skin": 2500, "outfit": 1800, "shoes": 300, "hair": 900}},
               {"tris": {"skin": 700, "outfit": 500, "shoes": 80, "hair": 250}, "skip": ["eyes"], "error": 0.08}] }
  ]
}
```

**Realistic characters.** A hero output's `keep` lists roles whose colour maps keep their authored colour
(no detail map, `tint: false` on the material): the page leaves them undyed, so a realistic export's
skin and cloth look as made, and the picker's look chooses among several exports by their `fits`
instead of dyeing one. Leave a MetaHuman's lashes out of `keep`: their colour map is near white (Unreal
colours them in the material), so kept they draw white; dyed, the page makes them near black. `orm` lists roles (`outfit` for top and bottom) that get one packed map in
glTF's layout: R occlusion from the source's occlusion map, G roughness from its metallic-roughness
map (else the role's constant), B metalness 0, since people are not metal (Ready Player Me exports
ship greyscale maps that would otherwise make trousers a third metallic). The occlusion comes from a
bake: in Blender 5.2, select the character's meshes, give each material an image node for the target,
bake `AO` in Cycles with the world's AO distance near 0.25 m and everything else hidden from render,
then connect each image (its R) to a `glTF Material Output` group's `Occlusion` input and export the
selection as GLB without animations or shape keys. That GLB is the hero's source. A hero output's `rough` (by role) overrides the
roughness a role gets when it has no map, e.g. `{"hair": 0.75}` for hair cards, which read as a
shiny helmet at the stand-in's 0.55.

A hero output's `thin` maps a source material's name to a greyscale image (a path from the config's
folder) that is 1 where skin is thin enough to glow when lit from behind, ears and fingers, and 0
elsewhere. It goes into the blue channel of that material's packed map (glTF's metalness, which the
material's `metallicFactor` of 0 leaves unused), the material is marked `thin`, and the page lets light
through there. The material's role must be in `orm`. One way to make the image: in Blender, bake
`EMIT` from an Ambient Occlusion node set to `Inside` with a distance of 2.5 cm, inverted, then keep
only the ears and fingers (lips and eyelids also read thin, but behind them is the mouth or the eye,
not daylight; MetaHuman's head UVs keep the face within u 0.25..0.75). A MetaHuman body's UVs sit in
UDIM tile 1002 (u 1..2): shift them by -1 for the bake, or it writes nothing. The pipeline itself moves
any primitive whose UVs lie in one tile other than the first into 0..1 when it reads a source: the page
clamps people's textures to the edge, so a body left in tile 1002 drew every map from one column.

**Eyes.** MetaHuman draws its eyes with a refracting shell and a separate shadow mesh, both of which
the role rules drop (`eyeshell`, `occlusion`). Without them the eyeballs look painted on: bake the
lids' shadow (an `AO` bake within about 1.2 cm, head visible) into the eye colour. Both eyes share one
UV square, so move each to its own half of a 2:1 atlas first, or one eye's corner shadow lands on the
other's wrong side.

A crowd character's `dropNodes` (node or mesh names) leaves out props its file carries (a chair,
a briefcase).

**Files that may not be redistributed** (MetaHuman, Fab) never go into the package: set `"out"` to the
operator's own folder, `~/.agentdata/world/people/` (or `$AGENTDATA_WORLD_PEOPLE_DIR`), and write its
own `people.json` there. With that manifest present the server answers `/static/world/people/` from
the folder, falling back file by file to the stand-in; without it, the stand-in is served
(`serve.people_file`). Nothing in the repository changes.

For the stand-in itself, edit `agentdata/fleet/static/world/people/people.json`: `hero` lists the hero files (each with
`fits`, e.g. `{"figure": "curved", "age": "older"}`, so the picker's look chooses the closest export),
`crowd` the crowd files, `hair`/`face`/`glasses` map picker values to styles, `morphs` maps figure,
build and age values to morph weights (empty for exports without variants), and `clips.idle` may name an
animation clip in the hero file. Add every new file to the folder's `LICENSE`; the test
`test_the_worlds_people_are_the_ones_it_loads_credited_and_bounded` holds the folder to the manifest,
the LICENSE and 5 MiB.

## The stand-in

How `standin.glb` and `standin_crowd.glb` were made, from MakeHuman's CC0 assets (credited in
`agentdata/fleet/static/world/people/LICENSE`, with each download's sha256). The raw files are not
committed: `dl/`, `bvenv/`, `raw/` and `out/` here are ignored by git.

1. Download MPFB 2 and the CC0 asset packs into `dl/`:

       mkdir -p dl
       curl -sSL -o dl/mpfb2-20260911.zip https://files.makehumancommunity.org/plugins/mpfb2-20260911.zip
       for p in makehuman_system_assets bodyparts05 glasses01 hair01; do
         curl -sSL -o dl/${p}_cc0.zip https://files.makehumancommunity.org/asset_packs/$p/${p}_cc0.zip
       done
       sha256sum dl/*.zip    # compare with the people folder's LICENSE

2. Blender as a Python module, 4.5, in `bvenv/` (Python 3.11): `python3.11 -m venv bvenv`, then
   `bvenv/bin/pip install "bpy==4.5.*" numpy`.
3. `bvenv/bin/python install_mpfb.py` installs MPFB into that Blender and prints its user data folder.
   Unzip each `*_cc0.zip` there (the packs' folders: clothes, eyebrows, eyelashes, eyes, hair, skins).
4. `python3 specs.py` writes each character's spec (the hero and its five body variants, five
   pedestrians) to `raw/` and runs `mh_make.py` on it, which builds the character with MPFB, rigs it
   with the game-engine rig (Unreal Engine bone names) and exports `raw/<name>.glb`.
5. From `tools/world`: `node people/people.mjs people/standin.config.json`, then copy
   `people/out/*.glb` to `agentdata/fleet/static/world/people/`.
